/*
Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Solution: (1) use extra memory: boolean array to track. 
          (2) bit manipulation: XOR. 4 ^ 4 = 0 (clear)
